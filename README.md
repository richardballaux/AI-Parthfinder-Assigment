# ToolBox-AI

This was a school assignment I made for my Olin class, Software Design in the fall of 2018.

Instructions are on [the toolbox page](https://sd18fall.github.io/toolboxes/algorithms-and-ai).

## Content
The script open a window that has a 10 by 10 square. The player can click on squares to make them into lava or swamp. When you press the spacebar the computer calculates the fastest path to cross the window.

## Result
The character can jump over lava (which gives him 2 extra delay)and/or go through the swamp (which gives him 8 extra delay).
